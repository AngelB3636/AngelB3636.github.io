11. To beat the Ender Dragon, you need a bow, around 40 arrows, and 5-6 beds.

Kill spiders to gather cobwebs, which you can then turn into string. Combine string with sticks to craft a bow.

Arrows are made from flint, sticks, and feathers. Gather feathers by killing chickens in the village, flint by mining shoal blocks near water, and sticks from cutting down trees.

There are two ways to acquire beds:
<ul>
<li>
Craft them from wool and wooden planks. Acquire wool by using shears to shave sheep.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Steal them from houses in the village.  
</li>
</ul>

12. Once you have the equipment for the fight, go back to the stronghold and look for the portal room. It spawns at random, so it might take a while. Then, place the 12 ender pearls in the 12 slots and jump through the portal.

13.The Ender Dragon fight has two phases. In the first phase, you will need to use the bow and arrow to shoot at crystals on top of pillars to make the dragon fly closer to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Once you have the dragon in range, quickly drop a bed, and then attempt to sleep. Trying to sleep while in the End dimension will cause the bed to explode and deal massive damage to anything near it. To prevent it from damaging you, place a random block between yourself and the bed.
</p>
<p>
Detonating the bed near the dragon’s head will deal the most damage. It usually takes around 5-6 beds to kill the dragon. The run is complete the moment the dragon drops dead.

Congratulations, you’ve completed your first Minecraft speedrun!

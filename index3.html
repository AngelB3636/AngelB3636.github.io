10. Ender eyes can be used to triangulate the location of the stronghold, the place where the end portal resides. To do this, throw an ender eye in the air, and note the direction in which it is looking. This is the direction you need to follow to find the stronghold. Repeat the process three times from different angles to zero in on the location of the stronghold.
